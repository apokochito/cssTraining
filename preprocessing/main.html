  <h3>CSS is not a programming language, it's a style sheet language</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Before you practice... </p>
    <p>1. Make sure that you have node and sass installed in your system.</p>
    <p>2. You need to be able to execute: sass source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css</p>
    <pre>          CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex,
          and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help.
          Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting,
          mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies that make writing CSS fun again.
    </pre>

                -- Command --
                $ sass --watch input.scss output.css

                -- SASS --
                $font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;
                $primary-color: #333;

                body {
                  font: 100% $font-stack;
                  color: $primary-color;
                }
            </pre>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <h5>Once Sass is installed, and you write your Sass file with all your styles, you can compile it to CSS using the sass command.</h5>
            <h5>The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for changes, and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass.</h5>
            <h5>You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass uses the $ symbol to make something a variable.</h5>
        </div>
